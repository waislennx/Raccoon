## Software

- ⭐️Own code. Our build is not a fork of products already existing on the market.
- ⭐️The stealer is written in C/C++.
- ⭐️Our build will give you an excellent response with every spill, because Raccoon is noticed by only a few antiviruses under dynamic test conditions.
- ⭐️Raccoon collects: passwords, cookies and autofill from all popular browsers (including FireFox x64), CC data, system information
- ⭐️Almost all existing desktop cryptocurrency wallets, including the Brave browser wallet and the Metamask extension wallet.
- ⭐️Built-in file downloader.
- ⭐️Works on both 32 and 64-bit systems without .NET dependencies.
- ⭐️Output file - Native x86 executable, easy to encrypt.
- ⭐️Private key, gate address and all other string values   are heavily encrypted.
- ⭐️The stealer stores most of the collected data in RAM, not on disk.
- ⭐️File grabber.
- ⭐️Dropper for one or more files with the ability to filter by queries contained in passwords and cookies.
- ⭐️No need to create a new build when changing the gate! The entire transfer occurs unnoticed by the user.
- ⭐️Configuration changes occur on the fly. Without rebuilding the build.
- ⭐️Each build has a unique signature. A person who leaks a build on VT is easily identified and banned from the service without a refund.
